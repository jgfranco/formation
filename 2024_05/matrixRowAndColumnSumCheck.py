❓ PROMPT
Given two arrays, `rowSums` and `columnSums`, and a rectangular matrix. Check to see if the two arrays are correct with respect to the matrix. Return true if the ith row sums to the value in `rowSums[i]` for every i and if the jth column sums to `columnSums[j]` for every j. Return false if any of these are incorrect.

Example(s)
matrix = [
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
]
rowSums = [3, 7]
columnSums = [4, 6]

will return true.

matrix = [
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
]
rowSums = [3, 7]
columnSums = [4, 7]

will return false.
