# Introduction: The project management life cycle and methodologies

Waterfall and Agile are the most common methodologies used in project management

## Project Life Cycle

1.	Initiate the project
`-	Define project goals and deliverables
	-	Identify the budget and needed resources
	-	People involved
	-	Any ANY OTHER DETAIL THAT CAN IMPACT The successful completion of the project `
2.	Make a plan
	-	should include:
		-	budget
	  -	breakdown of all the tasks
	  -	ways to communicate team roles and responsibilities
	  -	schedule
	  -	resources
	  -	what to do in case of problems or if things need to change
3.	Execute and complete tasks
	-	monitor progress
	-	remove obstacles
	-	keep the team motivated
4.	Close the project
	-	celebrate 
	-	evaluate what worked and what didnâ€™t 
	-	hand over the project to the team that will run the project (for some projects)


### Initiate the project
- define project goals
- determine resources, people and other project details
	- what you need to complete the project (software, equipment, rentals)
- get project approval

### Make a plan
- create a budget
- set the schedule
- establish your team
- determine roles and responsabilities
- plan for risk and change
	- legal issues, quality control, scheduling delays, budget changes, technology and software requirements
- Establish communications 

### Execute & complete tasks
- Manage the progress
- Communicate
	- err on the side of over-communication
- Make adjustments


### Close the project 
- Ensure all tasks have been completed
	- check that all invoices have been paid
	- all resources have been properly returned
	- make sure project documentation has been submitted
- confirm acceptance of the project outcome
- Reflect on lessons learned "a retrospective".
- Communicate results to stakeholders
- Celebrate completing the project 
	- company or team-wide email
	- party!
- Formally move on from the project
	- so you and your teammates can move to other pursuits 

## Introduction to project management methodologies

Project management methodology: a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle

Linear: means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start. (like bulding a house)

Iterative: means some of the pahses and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on. (produce a new tv show)

## Waterfall
- originates in the 70s
- sequential order of phases
- it has a linear approach
- Comes from traditional engineering and manufacturing
- use it when tasks are dependent on other tasks
- use it when you are not expecting to much changes along the project 

## Agile
- originated in the 90s, becase of software development
- able to move quickly and easily
- Willing to change and adapt
- Done in pieces
- Agile project phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations, which in Scrum are called Sprints
- for example, building a website can be done in Agile
	- you could publish the home of the website and postpone the launch of the blog or store for example

## Lean Six Sigma

Steps of LSS (DMAIC)
1. Define
- similar to initiate project
2. Measure
- map the current process to find its weaknesses throug the gather of data
3. Analyze
- this is basically data analysis
- Identify gaps and issues
4. Improve
- present your findings and get ready to start improvements
5. Control
- is all about learning from the work you did up front to put new processes and documentation in place
