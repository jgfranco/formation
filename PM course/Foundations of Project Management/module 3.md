# Introduction: The project management life cycle and methodologies

Waterfall and Agile are the most common methodologies used in project management

## Project Life Cycle

1.	Initiate the project
`-	Define project goals and deliverables
	-	Identify the budget and needed resources
	-	People involved
	-	Any ANY OTHER DETAIL THAT CAN IMPACT The successful completion of the project `
2.	Make a plan
	-	should include:
		-	budget
	  -	breakdown of all the tasks
	  -	ways to communicate team roles and responsibilities
	  -	schedule
	  -	resources
	  -	what to do in case of problems or if things need to change
3.	Execute and complete tasks
	-	monitor progress
	-	remove obstacles
	-	keep the team motivated
4.	Close the project
	-	celebrate 
	-	evaluate what worked and what didn’t 
	-	hand over the project to the team that will run the project (for some projects)


### Initiate the project
- define project goals
- determine resources, people and other project details
	- what you need to complete the project (software, equipment, rentals)
- get project approval

### Make a plan
- create a budget
- set the schedule
- establish your team
- determine roles and responsabilities
- plan for risk and change
	- legal issues, quality control, scheduling delays, budget changes, technology and software requirements
- Establish communications 

### Execute & complete tasks
- Manage the progress
- Communicate
	- err on the side of over-communication
- Make adjustments


### Close the project 
- Ensure all tasks have been completed
	- check that all invoices have been paid
	- all resources have been properly returned
	- make sure project documentation has been submitted
- confirm acceptance of the project outcome
- Reflect on lessons learned "a retrospective".
- Communicate results to stakeholders
- Celebrate completing the project 
	- company or team-wide email
	- party!
- Formally move on from the project
	- so you and your teammates can move to other pursuits 

## Introduction to project management methodologies

Project management methodology: a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle

Linear: means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start. (like bulding a house)

Iterative: means some of the pahses and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on. (produce a new tv show)

## Waterfall
- originates in the 70s, from traditional engineering and manufacturing
- sequential order of phases
- it has a linear approach

- use it when tasks are dependent on other tasks
- use it when you are not expecting to much changes along the project 

## Agile
- originated in the 90s, becase of software development
- able to move quickly and easily
- Willing to change and adapt
- Done in pieces
- Agile project phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations, which in Scrum are called Sprints
- for example, building a website can be done in Agile
	- you could publish the home of the website and postpone the launch of the blog or store for example

## Lean Six Sigma

Steps of LSS (DMAIC)
1. Define
- similar to initiate project
2. Measure
- map the current process to find its weaknesses throug the gather of data
3. Analyze
- this is basically data analysis
- Identify gaps and issues
4. Improve
- present your findings and get ready to start improvements
5. Control
- is all about learning from the work you did up front to put new processes and documentation in place


## Lean 
The main principle in Lean methodology is the reduce of waste
Types of waste:
- Lack of proper documentation
- Lack of process standards
- Not understanding the customers’ needs
- Lack of effective communication
- Lack of process control
- Inefficient process design
- Failures of management

### Lean 5S
1. Sort: remove not needed items. Leave only the bare essentials
2. Set in order: Arrange items so thet are easy to use. Label items that anyone cna find them or put them away.
3. Shine: Keep eveything in its place. Clean your workspace everyday.
4. Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. 
5. Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill discipline in your team

## Six Sigma
The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:

1. Always focus on the customer.
2. Identify and understand how the work gets done.Understand how work really happens.
3. Make your processes flow smoothly.
4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
5. Stop defects by removing variation.
6. Involve and collaborate with your team.
7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.
