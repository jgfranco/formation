Given an org chart of a company, employee A, and employee B: 
figure out if employee B is a direct report to employee A.

Employee B must report directly to employee A - this occurs 
if Employee A is the parent node of Employee B.

Employees in our tree are represented as integer values (eg: 1).

Return true if employee A manages employee B, false if not.

Example(s)
      1  <---- ceo
     / \
    2   3
       / \
      4   5

isDirectReport(ceo, 1, 2) == True
isDirectReport(ceo, 1, 4) == False
isDirectReport(ceo, 2, 1) == False
isDirectReport(ceo, 2, 3) == False
isDirectReport(ceo, 3, 4) == True

List your assumptions & discoveries:
employee B must be employee's A child

üß† BRAINSTORM
What approaches could work?
find employee A (via BFS) and if employee B is part of its children return True, otherwise return False
