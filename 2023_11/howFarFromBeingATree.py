‚ùì PROMPT
Suppose you are given the root of a *Node* class for a supposed N-ary tree.

This *Node* class has a *children* method that returns a list of *Node* children.

However, this tree is actually corrupted! There may be edges in the *children* class that break the basic rules of trees, resulting in possible cycles or multiple parents.

How many edges do you need to remove from this faulty tree to construct a valid tree?

Example(s)
    1
  /   \
  2   3
   \ /
    4
return 1
Explanation: 4 has two parents. We can remove any one of them to create a valid tree.

    1 <--
  /   \ |
  2   3 |
   \    |
    4 --|
return 1
Explanation: 4 loops back to the root (1). We can remove this back edge to create a valid tree.
 

üîé EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:
a visited set should help us determine the amount of "errors"
 

Insightful & revealing test cases:
 

üß† BRAINSTORM
What approaches could work?
Algorithm 1: traverse the tree-like structure using a queue BFS style
use a visited set, whenever we find a node already in visited set means that we are encountering either a loop
or a node with multiple parents:
Time: O(n) wwe need to visit every node in the tree-like structure
Space: O(n) we are gonna keep a record of every visited node
